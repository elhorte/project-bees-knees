#The error you're encountering is a `ValueError` that states `x and y must have the same first dimension, but have shapes (25,) and (49,)`. This error is raised in the `plt.plot(bucket_freqs, np.abs(buckets))` line. 

#The error means that the variables `bucket_freqs` and `buckets` don't have the same shape, and thus they cannot be plotted together. This issue arises from the following lines:

#```python
# Average buckets
buckets = np.array([yf[i:i+bucket_size].mean() for i in range(0, len(yf), bucket_size)])
bucket_freqs = np.array([xf[i:i+bucket_size].mean() for i in range(0, len(xf), bucket_size)])
#```

#Here, you're dividing the FFT results (`yf` and `xf`) into 'buckets' and then taking the mean of each bucket. The number of buckets is determined by the `bucket_size`. 

#The issue is that `yf` and `xf` might not be divisible by `bucket_size`, which means the last bucket will be smaller than the others. When you calculate the mean of this smaller bucket, you get a single value, but you're still trying to plot it as if it were a full-sized bucket. This mismatch in sizes between `bucket_freqs` and `buckets` is causing the error.

#To fix this, you can either:

#1. Discard the remainder of the division (i.e., the last smaller bucket), which might result in loss of some data, or
#2. Pad the last smaller bucket to make it the same size as the other buckets, which might introduce some noise in the data.

#Here is an example of how to discard the remainder of the division:

#```python
# Calculate number of full buckets
num_full_buckets = len(yf) // bucket_size

# Only take full buckets
yf = yf[:num_full_buckets*bucket_size]
xf = xf[:num_full_buckets*bucket_size]

# Average buckets
buckets = np.array([yf[i:i+bucket_size].mean() for i in range(0, len(yf), bucket_size)])
bucket_freqs = np.array([xf[i:i+bucket_size].mean() for i in range(0, len(xf), bucket_size)])
#```

#This will ensure `bucket_freqs` and `buckets` have the same shape, and you should be able to plot them together without getting an error.

#The second part of the error message is an `OSError` with the message `exception: access violation reading 0x0000000000000008`. This error typically means that the program tried to read or write to a memory location that it doesn't have access to.

#This error seems to be coming from the `keyboard` module, specifically from the `listen` function. It's possible that the `keyboard` module is conflicting with another part of your code or with some other software on your system. This might require a bit more investigation, and you might need to try running your code on a different system or in a different environment to see if the error persists. You might also want to check if there are any known issues or bugs with the `keyboard` module that could be causing this error.
