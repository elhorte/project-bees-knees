I have a python script that runs in a terminal in Windows 11 using PowerShell.

The path to the program is:  E:\git\eb\project-bees-knees\beehub\python\src> 

It runs in a ’venv’ environment that is launched with: ‘ .\auntbee\Scripts\Activate.ps1’ from the ‘src’ folder.

The program has a module called ’user_interface.py’ that monitors the keyboard and allows the user to run various monitoring functions use single character input from the keyboard.

I wish to code the overall user interface function to detect the ‘^’ key to activate and deactivagte the keyboard listener. This is so that a user can disable the keyboard listener to perfome normal command line functhions in the terminal while the program continues to run in the background.

When the user presses ‘^’, the keyboard listener needs to stop interpreting keystrokes and just pass all keystriokes through to the terminal transparently other than the ‘^’ key which re-enables the listener to then continue interpreting keystrokes from the user.

Please examine the work so far to achieve this goal stated above. The primary work has been in the ‘user_interface.py’ module in the ‘modules’ subfolder of ‘src’. All other modules of the program are also in the same ‘modules’ folder. 

The program launches from main.py found in the ‘src’ folder.
