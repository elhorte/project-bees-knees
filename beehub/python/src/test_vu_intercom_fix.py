Test script for VU meter and intercom independence

print("Changes made:")
print("1. ✅ VU meter 'v' command is suppressed when intercom is running")
print("2. ✅ Completely removed ALL VU meter code from intercom function")
print("3. ✅ Optimized VU meter buffer size (256 samples = ~5.8ms at 44100Hz)")
print("4. ✅ Updated help text to explain independent operation")

print("Expected behavior:")
print("- Start VU meter first with 'v' → get fast, responsive VU display")
print("- Start intercom with 'i' → pure audio monitoring, NO built-in VU meter")
print("- Both run completely independently with zero conflicts")
print("- Pressing 'v' while intercom is active shows helpful message")
print("- Intercom has zero VU calculations, zero level processing, zero display")
print("")
print("To test:")
print("1. Run main BMAR application")
print("2. Press 'v' to start VU meter (should be fast and responsive)")
print("3. Press 'i' to start intercom (pure audio monitoring, no VU display)")
print("4. Both should work together perfectly with no slowdowns")
print("5. Try pressing 'v' again (should show suppression message)")
print("6. Stop intercom with 'i', then 'v' should work again")
print("")
print("This restores the original BMAR behavior where VU meter and intercom")
print("operated as completely independent processes with no shared code.")
