I have a python script that runs in a terminal in Windows 11 using PowerShell.

The path to the program is:  E:\git\eb\project-bees-knees\beehub\python\src> 

It runs in a ’venv’ environment that is launched with: ‘ .\auntbee\Scripts\Activate.ps1’ from the ‘src’ folder.

The program has a module called ’user_interface.py’ that monitors the keyboard and allows the user to run various monitoring functions use single character input from the keyboard.

I wish to code the overall user interface function to detect the ‘^’ key to activate and deactivagte the keyboard listener. This is so that a user can disable the keyboard listener to perfome normal command line functhions in the terminal while the program continues to run in the background.

When the user presses ‘^’, the keyboard listener needs to stop interpreting keystrokes and just pass all keystriokes through to the terminal transparently other than the ‘^’ key which re-enables the listener to then continue interpreting keystrokes from the user.

Please examine the work so far to achieve this goal stated above. The primary work has been in the ‘user_interface.py’ module in the ‘modules’ subfolder of ‘src’. All other modules of the program are also in the same ‘modules’ folder. 

The program launches from main.py found in the ‘src’ folder.



 This python program is launched from:
       "E:\git\earth_biometrics\project-bees-knees\beehub\python\src"
The program operates in a venv environment activated by:
        ".\auntbee\Scripts\Activate.ps1" which is executed from the "src" folder

The current implementation of the user_interface.py module has a function to watch keyboard input and trigger functions based on single key entries such as 'o' triggers an oscilloscopt plot image of the audio input. The module also watches for the caret key to disable the trapping and respoinding to keyboard entry. In the disabled keyboard enty trapping mode, the function is supposed to output any keyboard entry to the terminal transparently (as if it were not watcing the keyboard). Then, when the caret key is detected a second time, the keyboard listener function once again interprets keyboard entry and executes corresponding functions. 

You have tied many times to get the key stroke passthru in disabled mode to work but it still is not. 

Please examine the module named "keyboard monitor examples.py" in the 'modules' folder showing two examples, one for linux/MacOS and the other for Windows. Please attempt to incorporate that approach into the "user_interface.py" script to correct the key stroke passthru issue in the current codebase.
